# Apple Team (Developer)

One of the biggest challenges in distributing Ad-Hoc signed applications for iOS is the need to
convey what a UDID is and how to obtain it to a large number of people who may not understand
these concepts. After obtaining the UDID, it then needs to be provided to the developer,
who must then re-sign the certificate, package it, and upload it for installation.

Zealot can automatically obtain the UDID of Ad-Hoc applications.
Although the UDIDs are usually accompanied by device names during registration,
sometimes it is difficult to understand which device belongs to whom when presented with a
list of UDIDs. To solve this problem, Zealot has tried several solutions. In the early days,
the fastlane plugin zealotsyncdevice was used to synchronize the names and models of testing devices.
With the release of the AppStoreConnect API, Zealot can now completely automate the process,
greatly simplifying the registration process and allowing testing applications to display
recognizable and friendly device names.

Although providing the UDID of a device confirms which applications can be installed,
providing a feature to register a testing device that has not been registered with any application
would greatly improve the efficiency of the team. This is the role of the Apple Developer feature.
