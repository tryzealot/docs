# Archived App

Since [#1886](https://github.com/tryzealot/zealot/pull/1886) version, a new feature allows archiving and unarchiving apps.
All archived apps are moved to the **Archived Apps** page in the sidebar navigation menu.

Apps can switch between archived and active states, but archived apps can only be deleted.
If you need to edit or change any state within the app, you must unarchive it first.
